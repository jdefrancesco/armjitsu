Getting started:

    It is recommended you work in a virtual environment (virtualenv) for the project.
    Once you have obtained the repo (if you're reading this it means you probably already have), you can setup your development environment like so

    $ virtualenv venv
    $ source venv/bin/activate
    $ pip install -r requirments.txt
